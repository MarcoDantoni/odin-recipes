    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Sushi (すし, 寿司, 鮨, 鮓; pronounced [sɯɕiꜜ] or [sɯꜜɕi] ⓘ) is a traditional Japanese dish made with vinegared rice (鮨飯, sushi-meshi), typically seasoned with sugar and salt, and combined with a variety of ingredients (ねた, neta), such as seafood, vegetables, or meat; raw seafood is the most common, although some may be cooked. While sushi has numerous styles and presentations, the current defining component is the vinegared rice, also known as shari (しゃり), or sumeshi (酢飯).</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Rice: 2 cups Japanese short-grain rice, 2.5 cups water, 4-5 tbsp rice vinegar, 2 tbsp sugar, 1 tsp salt.</li>
        <li>Wraps: 5-6 sheets of Nori (seaweed).</li>
        <li>Fillings: Sashimi-grade salmon or tuna, crab sticks, cucumber, avocado, cream cheese, or carrots.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse: Rinse the rice 3-4 times until the water runs clear.</li>
        <li>Cook: Cook the rice in a rice cooker or on the stove (bring to a boil, then simmer on low for 15 mins covered).</li>
        <li>Season: While hot, stir in the mixture of rice vinegar, sugar, and salt until fully incorporated.</li>
        <li>Cool: Let the rice cool to room temperature before rolling to avoid tearing the seaweed.</li>
    </ol>
